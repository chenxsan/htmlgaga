Manage your html templates & their static assets better for any server-side languages.

## Why?

Writing single page application nowadays is enjoyable with JavaScript libraries like [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), etc. But not every page should be written in these libraries. We still write a lot of HTML for server-side languages like PHP, Node and the like.

You might have tried [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to manage static assets for your HTML, but how about HTML itself? Seems it's left unmanaged which means we have to duplicate our HTML pages a lot making them difficult to maintain in the future.

HTMLgaga would love to tackle the problem :)

## How

HTMLgaga manages your html templates & their static assets with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and React server side render.

Yes, it is crazy if you don't write React at all. Actually I would suggest you sticking to your current tech stack in that case.
