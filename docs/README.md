# HTMLgaga

Manage multiple non-SPA pages with webpack and React.js

## Who may need htmlgaga

:::tip
You might skip HTMLgaga if you're full stack developer since most server side frameworks already provide built-in tools like [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) to manage assets.
:::

Say you are a front end developer creating HTML pages with JavaScript/CSS from prototype and design, after you done your job, QA or product manager might want to validate your HTML pages before handing them off to back end developer. HTMLgaga is built for you then.

## But why

Writing single page application nowadays is enjoyable with JavaScript libraries like [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), etc. But not every page should be written in these libraries. We still write a lot of HTML for server-side languages like PHP, Node and the like.

You might have tried [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to manage static assets for your HTML, but how about HTML itself? It's left alone which means we have to duplicate our HTML pages a lot making them difficult to maintain in the future. Also webpack manages static assets much better than grunt or gulp alike.

## How

With htmlgaga, you could write your pages in components and get them built into static html pages with webpack & React server side rendering.

Yes, it may sounds crazy if you don't write React at all. But seriously, [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is as simple as html when you use it only for server side rendering.
