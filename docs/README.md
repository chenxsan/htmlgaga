# HTMLgaga

Manage your html templates & their static assets better for any server-side languages.

## Who

:::tip
If you're full stack developer, you could skip HTMLgaga since most server side frameworks provide built-in tools like [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) to manage assets.
:::

Say you are a front end developer creating HTML pages with JavaScript/CSS from prototype and design, after you finish your job, QA or product manager might want to double check your HTML pages before transfering them to back end developer. HTMLgaga is built for you then.

## Why?

Writing single page application nowadays is enjoyable with JavaScript libraries like [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), etc. But not every page should be written in these libraries. We still write a lot of HTML for server-side languages like PHP, Node and the like.

You might have tried [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to manage static assets for your HTML, but how about HTML itself? Seems it's left unmanaged which means we have to duplicate our HTML pages a lot making them difficult to maintain in the future.

HTMLgaga would love to tackle the problem :)

## How

HTMLgaga manages your html templates & their static assets with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and React server side render.

Yes, it is crazy if you don't write React at all. Actually I would suggest you sticking to your current tech stack in that case.

But if you do want to have a try, [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is quite simple, and it won't take you too long to learn.
