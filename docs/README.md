# HTMLgaga

Manage multiple non-SPA pages with webpack and React.js

## Who

:::tip
You might skip HTMLgaga if you're full stack developer since most server side frameworks provide built-in tools like [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) to manage assets.
:::

Say you are a front end developer creating HTML pages with JavaScript/CSS from prototype and design, after you finish them, QA or product manager might want to validate your HTML pages before transfering them to back end developer. HTMLgaga is built for you then.

## Why?

Writing single page application nowadays is enjoyable with JavaScript libraries like [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), etc. But not every page should be written in these libraries. We still write a lot of HTML for server-side languages like PHP, Node and the like.

You might have tried [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/) or [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to manage static assets for your HTML, but how about HTML itself? It's left alone which means we have to duplicate our HTML pages a lot making them difficult to maintain in the future.

HTMLgaga would love to tackle the problem :)

## How

HTMLgaga manages your html templates & their static assets with [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and React server side render.

Yes, it is crazy if you don't write React at all. But [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is quite simple when you use it only for server side rendering, and it won't take you too long to learn.
