# voidjs

Manage non-SPA pages with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/)

## Why voidjs

voidjs is designed for managing non-SPA HTML pages. It brings a lot of benefits of webpack and React to non-SPA HTML pages developing.

1. Better assets' management with webpack
2. Manage html with **Components**, no more error-prone copy & paste
3. Pre-built static HTML

## Use cases

1. You want to write some simple static html pages without any JavaScript or a few JavaScript Code.
2. You want to write html templates for server side languages other than Node.js, e.g., PHP.
