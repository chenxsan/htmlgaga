htmlgaga is a monorepo managed with yarn 2, please make sure you have [yarn 2](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) installed first.

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `yarn` to install depedencies
3. Run `yarn preconstruct dev` to set up typescript compiling.

If you are on Windows you might want to enable [Developer mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#accessing-settings-for-developers) because yarn depends on symlinks to work.
