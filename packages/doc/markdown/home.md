1. Writing html pages without JavaScript.
2. Writing html pages with a few vanilla JavaScript.
3. Writing html templates for server side languages other than Node.js, e.g., PHP.

## Get started

- To create a new voidjs project, run `npm init`:
  ```bash
  npm init voidjs ./my-app
  ```
- Or if you are using `yarn`, run `yarn create`:
  ```bash
  yarn create voidjs ./my-app
  ```

## Development

Run `npm run dev` under your newly created project.

## Production

Run `npm run build` under your project and voidjs will build the project to `out` directory.
